Crucial content of this folder are mol_struct_module.py and STRUCT.fdf files. 

Python file defines module for handling molecular structure, 
its shifting, rotating and writing/reading in two formats: .fdf and .xyz.
In the end of the module, few examples of the usage is included.
(In future, class for molecular trajectory will be added.)

STRUCT.fdf includes example of a molecule with NH2 linkers
connectected to a golden pentimer in a periodic lattice.
